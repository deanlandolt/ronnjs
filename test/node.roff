.SH "NAME"
\fBnode\fR \-\- evented I/O for V8 JavaScript
.
.SH "Synopsis"
An example of a web server written with Node which responds with 'Hello
World':
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
var sys = require('sys'),
  http = require('http');
http.createServer(function (request, response) {
  response.writeHead(200, {'Content\-Type': 'text/plain'});
  response.end('Hello World\\n');
}).listen(8000);
sys.puts('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/');
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
To run the server, put the code into a file called \fBexample.js\fR and execute
it with the node program
.
.IP "" 4

Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
All of the examples in the documentation can be run similarly.
.
.SH "Standard Modules"
Node comes with a number of modules that are compiled in to the process,
most of which are documented below.  The most common way to use these modules
is with \fBrequire('name')\fR and then assigning the return value to a local
variable with the same name as the module.
.
.P
Example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
var sys = require('sys');
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
It is possible to extend node with other modules.  See \fB'Modules'\fR
.
.SH "Buffers"
Pure Javascript is Unicode friendly but not nice to binary data.  When
dealing with TCP streams or the file system, it's necessary to handle octet
streams. Node has several strategies for manipulating, creating, and
consuming octet streams.
.
.P
Raw data is stored in instances of the \fBBuffer\fR class. A \fBBuffer\fR is similar
to an array of integers but corresponds to a raw memory allocation outside
the V8 heap. A \fBBuffer\fR cannot be resized.
Access the class with \fBrequire('buffer').Buffer\fR.
.
.P
Converting between Buffers and JavaScript string objects requires an explicit encoding
method.  Node supports 3 string encodings: UTF\-8 (\fB'utf8'\fR), ASCII (\fB'ascii'\fR), and
Binary (\fB'binary'\fR).
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB'ascii'\fR \- for 7 bit ASCII data only.  This encoding method is very fast, and will
strip the high bit if set.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB'binary'\fR \- for 8 bit binary data such as images.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB'utf8'\fR \- Unicode characters.  Many web pages and other document formats use UTF\-8.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "new Buffer(size)"
Allocates a new buffer of \fBsize\fR octets.
.
.SS "new Buffer(array)"
Allocates a new buffer using an \fBarray\fR of octets.
.
.SS "new Buffer(str, encoding = 'utf8')"
Allocates a new buffer containing the given \fBstr\fR.
.
.SS "buffer.write(string, encoding, offset)"
Writes \fBstring\fR to the buffer at \fBoffset\fR using the given encoding. Returns
number of octets written.  If \fBbuffer\fR did not contain enough space to fit
the entire string it will write a partial amount of the string. In the case
of \fB'utf8'\fR encoding, the method will not write partial characters.
.
.P
Example: write a utf8 string into a buffer, then print it
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
var sys = require('sys'),
  Buffer = require('buffer').Buffer,
  buf = new Buffer(256),
  len;
len = buf.write('\\u00bd + \\u00bc = \\u00be', 'utf8', 0);
sys.puts(len + " bytes: " + buf.toString('utf8', 0, len));
// 12 bytes: ½ + ¼ = ¾
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "buffer.toString(encoding, start, end)"
Decodes and returns a string from buffer data encoded with \fBencoding\fR
beginning at \fBstart\fR and ending at \fBend\fR.
.
.P
See \fBbuffer.write()\fR example, above.
.
.SS "buffer[index]"
Get and set the octet at \fBindex\fR. The values refer to individual bytes,
so the legal range is between \fB0x00\fR and \fB0xFF\fR hex or \fB0\fR and \fB255\fR.
.
.P
Example: copy an ASCII string into a buffer, one byte at a time:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
var sys = require('sys'),
  Buffer = require('buffer').Buffer,
  str = "node.js",
  buf = new Buffer(str.length),
  i;

  buf[i] = str.charCodeAt(i);
}
sys.puts(buf);
// node.js
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "Buffer.byteLength(string, encoding)"
Gives the actual byte length of a string.  This is not the same as\fBString.prototype.length\fR since that returns the number of \fIcharacters\fR in a
string.
.
.P
Example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
var sys = require('sys'),
  Buffer = require('buffer').Buffer,
  str = '\\u00bd + \\u00bc = \\u00be';
sys.puts(str + ": " + str.length + " characters, " +
  Buffer.byteLength(str, 'utf8') + " bytes");
// ½ + ¼ = ¾: 9 characters, 12 bytes
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "buffer.length"
The size of the buffer in bytes.  Note that this is not necessarily the size
of the contents. \fBlength\fR refers to the amount of memory allocated for the
buffer object.  It does not change when the contents of the buffer are changed.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
var sys = require('sys'),
  Buffer = require('buffer').Buffer,
  buf = new Buffer(1234);
sys.puts(buf.length);
buf.write("some string", "ascii", 0);
sys.puts(buf.length);
// 1234
// 1234
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "buffer.copy(targetBuffer, targetStart, sourceStart, sourceEnd)"
Does a memcpy() between buffers.
.
.P
Example: build two Buffers, then copy \fBbuf1\fR from byte 16 through byte 20
into \fBbuf2\fR, starting at the 8th byte in \fBbuf2\fR.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
var sys = require('sys'),
  Buffer = require('buffer').Buffer,
  buf1 = new Buffer(26),
  buf2 = new Buffer(26),
  i;

  buf1[i] = i + 97; // 97 is ASCII a
  buf2[i] = 33; // ASCII !

buf1.copy(buf2, 8, 16, 20);
sys.puts(buf2.toString('ascii', 0, 25));
// !!!!!!!!qrst!!!!!!!!!!!!!

.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "buffer.slice(start, end)"
Returns a new buffer which references the
same memory as the old, but offset and cropped by the \fBstart\fR and \fBend\fR
indexes.
.
.P
\fBModifying the new buffer slice will modify memory in the original buffer!\fR
.
.P
Example: build a Buffer with the ASCII alphabet, take a slice, then modify one byte
from the original Buffer.
.
.IP "" 4

  buf1[i] = i + 97; // 97 is ASCII a
}
buf2 = buf1.slice(0, 3);
sys.puts(buf2.toString('ascii', 0, buf2.length));

.SH "EventEmitter"
Many objects in Node emit events: a TCP server emits an event each time
there is a stream, a child process emits an event when it exits. All
objects which emit events are instances of \fBevents.EventEmitter\fR.
.
.P
Events are represented by a camel\-cased string. Here are some examples:\fB'stream'\fR, \fB'data'\fR, \fB'messageBegin'\fR.
.
.P
Functions can be then be attached to objects, to be executed when an event
is emitted. These functions are called \fIlisteners\fR.
.
.P
\fBrequire('events').EventEmitter\fR to access the \fBEventEmitter\fR class.
.
.P
All EventEmitters emit the event \fB'newListener'\fR when new listeners are
added.
.
.P
When an EventEmitter experiences an error, the typical action is to emit an\fB'error'\fR event.  Error events are special\-\-if there is no handler for them
they will print a stack trace and exit the program.
.
.SS "Event: 'newListener'"
\fBfunction (event, listener) { }\fR
.
.P
This event is made any time someone adds a new listener.
.
.SS "Event: 'error'"
\fBfunction (exception) { }\fR
.
.P
If an error was encountered, then this event is emitted. This event is
special \- when there are no listeners to receive the error Node will
terminate execution and display the exception's stack trace.
.
.SS "emitter.addListener(event, listener)"
Adds a listener to the end of the listeners array for the specified event.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
server.addListener('stream', function (stream) {
  sys.puts('someone connected!');
});
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "emitter.removeListener(event, listener)"
Remove a listener from the listener array for the specified event.\fBCaution\fR: changes array indices in the listener array behind the listener.
.
.SS "emitter.removeAllListeners(event)"
Removes all listeners from the listener array for the specified event.
.
.SS "emitter.listeners(event)"
Returns an array of listeners for the specified event. This array can be
manipulated, e.g. to remove listeners.
.
.SS "emitter.emit(event, arg1, arg2, ...)"
Execute each of the listeners in order with the supplied arguments.
.
.SH "Streams"
A stream is an abstract interface implemented by various objects in Node.
For example a request to an HTTP server is a stream, as is stdout. Streams
are readable, writable, or both. All streams are instances of \fBEventEmitter\fR.
.
.SH "Readable Stream"
A \fBreadable stream\fR has the following methods, members, and events.
.
.SS "Event: 'data'"
\fBfunction (data) { }\fR
.
.P
The \fB'data'\fR event emits either a \fBBuffer\fR (by default) or a string if \fBsetEncoding()\fR was used.
.
.SS "Event: 'end'"
\fBfunction () { }\fR
.
.P
Emitted when the stream has received an EOF (FIN in TCP terminology).
Indicates that no more \fB'data'\fR events will happen. If the stream is also
writable, it may be possible to continue writing.
.
.SS "Event: 'error'"
\fBfunction (exception) { }\fR
.
.P
Emitted if there was an error receiving data.
.
.SS "Event: 'close'"
\fBfunction () { }\fR
.
.P
Emitted when the underlying file descriptor has be closed. Not all streams
will emit this.  (For example, an incoming HTTP request will not emit\fB'close'\fR.)
.
.SS "stream.setEncoding(encoding)"
Makes the data event emit a string instead of a \fBBuffer\fR. \fBencoding\fR can be \fB'utf8'\fR, \fB'ascii'\fR, or \fB'binary'\fR.
.
.SS "stream.pause()"
Pauses the incoming \fB'data'\fR events.
.
.SS "stream.resume()"
Resumes the incoming \fB'data'\fR events after a \fBpause()\fR.
.
.SS "stream.destroy()"
Closes the underlying file descriptor. Stream will not emit any more events.
.
.SH "Writable Stream"
A \fBwritable stream\fR has the following methods, members, and events.
.
.SS "Event: 'drain'"
\fBfunction () { }\fR
.
.P
Emitted after a \fBwrite()\fR method was called that returned \fBfalse\fR to
indicate that it is safe to write again.
.
.SS "Event: 'error'"
\fBfunction (exception) { }\fR
.
.P
Emitted on error with the exception \fBexception\fR.
.
.SS "Event: 'close'"
\fBfunction () { }\fR
.
.P
Emitted when the underlying file descriptor has been closed.
.
.SS "stream.write(string, encoding)"
Writes \fBstring\fR with the given \fBencoding\fR to the stream.  Returns \fBtrue\fR if
the string has been flushed to the kernel buffer.  Returns \fBfalse\fR to
indicate that the kernel buffer is full, and the data will be sent out in
the future. The \fB'drain'\fR event will indicate when the kernel buffer is
empty again. The \fBencoding\fR defaults to \fB'utf8'\fR.
.
.SS "stream.write(buffer)"
Same as the above except with a raw buffer.
.
.SS "stream.end()"
Terminates the stream with EOF or FIN.
.
.SS "stream.end(string, encoding)"
Sends \fBstring\fR with the given \fBencoding\fR and terminates the stream with EOF
or FIN. This is useful to reduce the number of packets sent.
.
.SS "stream.end(buffer)"
Same as above but with a \fBbuffer\fR.
.
.SS "stream.destroy()"
Closes the underlying file descriptor. Stream will not emit any more events.
.
.SH "Global Objects"
These object are available in the global scope and can be accessed from anywhere.
.
.SS "global"
The global namespace object.
.
.SS "process"
The process object. Most stuff lives in here. See the \fB'process object'\fR
section.
.
.SS "require()"
To require modules. See the \fB'Modules'\fR section.
.
.SS "require.paths"
An array of search paths for \fBrequire()\fR.  This array can be modified to add custom paths.
.
.P
Example: add a new path to the beginning of the search list
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
var sys = require('sys');
require.paths.unshift('/usr/local/node');
sys.puts(require.paths);
// /usr/local/node,/Users/mjr/.node_libraries
.

.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "__filename"
The filename of the script being executed.  This is the absolute path, and not necessarily
the same filename passed in as a command line argument.
.
.SS "__dirname"
The dirname of the script being executed.
.
.P
Example: running \fBnode example.js\fR from \fB/Users/mjr\fR
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
var sys = require('sys');
sys.puts(__filename);
sys.puts(__dirname);
// /Users/mjr/example.js
// /Users/mjr
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "module"
A reference to the current module (of type \fBprocess.Module\fR). In particular \fBmodule.exports\fR is the same as the \fBexports\fR object. See \fBsrc/process.js\fR
for more information.
.
.SH "process"
The \fBprocess\fR object is a global object and can be accessed from anywhere.
It is an instance of \fBEventEmitter\fR.
.
.SS "Event: 'exit'"
\fBfunction () {}\fR
.
.P
Emitted when the process is about to exit.  This is a good hook to perform
constant time checks of the module's state (like for unit tests).  The main
event loop will no longer be run after the 'exit' callback finishes, so
timers may not be scheduled.
.
.P
Example of listening for \fBexit\fR:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
var sys = require('sys');
process.addListener('exit', function () {
  process.nextTick(function () {
   sys.puts('This will not run');
  });
  sys.puts('About to exit.');
});
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "Event: 'uncaughtException'"
\fBfunction (err) { }\fR
.
.P
Emitted when an exception bubbles all the way back to the event loop. If a
listener is added for this exception, the default action (which is to print
a stack trace and exit) will not occur.
.
.P
Example of listening for \fBuncaughtException\fR:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
var sys = require('sys');
process.addListener('uncaughtException', function (err) {
  sys.puts('Caught exception: ' + err);
});
setTimeout(function () {
  sys.puts('This will still run.');
}, 500);
// Intentionally cause an exception, but don't catch it.
nonexistentFunc();
sys.puts('This will not run.');
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Note that \fBuncaughtException\fR is a very crude mechanism for exception
handling.  Using try / catch in your program will give you more control over
your program's flow.  Especially for server programs that are designed to
stay running forever, \fBuncaughtException\fR can be a useful safety mechanism.
.
.SS "Signal Events"
\fBfunction () {}\fR
.
.P
Emitted when the processes receives a signal. See sigaction(2) for a list of
standard POSIX signal names such as SIGINT, SIGUSR1, etc.
.
.P
Example of listening for \fBSIGINT\fR:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
var sys = require('sys'),
    stdin = process.openStdin();
process.addListener('SIGINT', function () {
  sys.puts('Got SIGINT.  Press Control\-D to exit.');
});
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
An easy way to send the \fBSIGINT\fR signal is with \fBControl\-C\fR in most terminal
programs.
.
.SS "process.stdout"
A writable stream to \fBstdout\fR.
.
.P
Example: the definition of \fBsys.puts\fR
.
.IP "" 4

.nf
exports.puts = function (d) {
  process.stdout.write(d + '\\n');
};
.
.fi

.SS "process.openStdin()"
Opens the standard input stream, returns a readable stream.
.

Example of opening standard input and listening for both events:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
var stdin = process.openStdin();
stdin.setEncoding('utf8');
stdin.addListener('data', function (chunk) {
  process.stdout.write('data: ' + chunk);

.SS "process.argv"
An array containing the command line arguments.  The first element will be
'node', the second element will be the name of the JavaScript file.  The
next elements will be any additional command line arguments.

.IP "" 0
.
.SS "process.compile(code, filename)"
Similar to \fBeval\fR except that you can specify a \fBfilename\fR for better
error reporting and the \fBcode\fR cannot see the local scope.  The value of \fBfilename\fR
will be used as a filename if a stack trace is generated by the compiled code.
.
.P
Example of using \fBprocess.compile\fR and \fBeval\fR to run the same code:
.

// localVar: 123, compiled: 1
// localVar: 1, evaled: 1
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
\fBprocess.compile\fR does not have access to the local scope, so \fBlocalVar\fR is unchanged. \fBeval\fR does have access to the local scope, so \fBlocalVar\fR is changed.

Child processes always have three streams associated with them. \fBchild.stdin\fR, \fBchild.stdout\fR, and \fBchild.stderr\fR.
.
.P
\fBChildProcess\fR is an EventEmitter.
.
.SS "Event:  'exit'"
\fBfunction (code, signal) {}\fR
.
.P
This event is emitted after the child process ends. If the process terminated
normally, \fBcode\fR is the final exit code of the process, otherwise \fBnull\fR. If
the process terminated due to receipt of a signal, \fBsignal\fR is the string name
of the signal, otherwise \fBnull\fR.

.SH "File System"
File I/O is provided by simple wrappers around standard POSIX functions.  To
use this module do \fBrequire('fs')\fR. All the methods have asynchronous and
synchronous forms.

The asynchronous form always take a completion callback as its last argument.
The arguments passed to the completion callback depend on the method, but the

Here is an example of the asynchronous version:

.
.SS "readStream.readable"
A boolean that is \fBtrue\fR by default, but turns \fBfalse\fR after an \fB'error'\fR
occured, the stream came to an \fB'end'\fR, or \fBdestroy()\fR was called.
.
.SS "readStream.pause()"
Stops the stream from reading further data. No \fB'data'\fR event will be fired
until the stream is resumed.
.
.SS "readStream.resume()"
Resumes the stream. Together with \fBpause()\fR this useful to throttle reading.
.
.SS "readStream.destroy()"
Allows to close the stream before the \fB'end'\fR is reached. No more events other
than \fB'close'\fR will be fired after this method has been called.
.
.SH "fs.WriteStream"
\fBWriteStream\fR is a writable stream.

occurred or \fBend()\fR / \fBdestroy()\fR was called.
.
.SS "writeStream.write(data, encoding='utf8')"
Returns \fBtrue\fR if the data was flushed to the kernel, and \fBfalse\fR if it was
queued up for being written later. A \fB'drain'\fR will fire after all queued data
has been written.
.
.P
The second optional parameter specifies the encoding of for the string.
.
.SS "writeStream.end()"
Closes the stream right after all queued \fBwrite()\fR calls have finished.

.SH "HTTP"
To use the HTTP server and client one must \fBrequire('http')\fR.
.
.P
The HTTP interfaces in Node are designed to support many features
of the protocol which have been traditionally difficult to use.
In particular, large, possibly chunk\-encoded, messages. The interface is
careful to never buffer entire requests or responses\-\-the
user is able to stream data.
.
.P
HTTP message headers are represented by an object like this:
.
.IP "" 4

.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Keys are lowercased. Values are not modified.
.
.P
In order to support the full spectrum of possible HTTP applications, Node's
HTTP API is very low\-level. It deals with stream handling and message
parsing only. It parses a message into headers and body but it does not
parse the actual headers or the body.
.
.P
HTTPS is supported if OpenSSL is available on the underlying platform.
.
.SH "http.Server"
This is an EventEmitter with the following events:
.
.SS "Event: 'request'"
\fBfunction (request, response) { }\fR
.
.P
 \fBrequest\fR is an instance of \fBhttp.ServerRequest\fR and \fBresponse\fR is
 an instance of \fBhttp.ServerResponse\fR
.
.SS "Event: 'connection'"
\fBfunction (stream) { }\fR
.
.P
 When a new TCP stream is established. \fBstream\fR is an object of type
 \fBnet.Stream\fR. Usually users will not want to access this event. The
 \fBstream\fR can also be accessed at \fBrequest.connection\fR.
.
.SS "Event: 'close'"
\fBfunction (errno) { }\fR
.
.P
 Emitted when the server closes.
.
.SS "http.createServer(requestListener, [options])"
Returns a new web server object.
.
.P
The \fBoptions\fR argument is optional. The \fBoptions\fR argument accepts the same values as the
options argument for \fBnet.Server\fR.
.
.P
The \fBrequestListener\fR is a function which is automatically
added to the \fB'request'\fR event.
.
.SS "Event: 'request'"
\fBfunction (request, response) {}\fR
.
.P
Emitted each time there is request. Note that there may be multiple requests
per connection (in the case of keep\-alive connections).
.
.SS "Event: 'upgrade'"
\fBfunction (request, socket, head)\fR
.
.P
Emitted each time a client requests a http upgrade. If this event isn't
listened for, then clients requesting an upgrade will have their connections
closed.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBrequest\fR is the arguments for the http request, as it is in the request event.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBsocket\fR is the network socket between the server and client.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBhead\fR is an instance of Buffer, the first packet of the upgraded stream, this may be empty.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
After this event is emitted, the request's socket will not have a \fBdata\fR
event listener, meaning you will need to bind to it in order to handle data
sent to the server on that socket.
.
.SS "Event: 'clientError'"
\fBfunction (exception) {}\fR
.
.P
If a client connection emits an 'error' event \- it will forwarded here.
.
.SS "server.listen(port, hostname)"
Begin accepting connections on the specified port and hostname.  If the
hostname is omitted, the server will accept connections directed to any
address.
.
.P
To listen to a unix socket, supply a filename instead of port and hostname.
.
.P
\fBIf you give a port number as a string, the system will interpret it as a filename in the current directory and create a unix socket.\fR
.
.P
This function is asynchronous. \fBlistening\fR will be emitted when the server
is ready to accept connections.
.
.SS "server.listen(path)"
Start a UNIX socket server listening for connections on the given \fBpath\fR.
This function is asynchronous. \fBlistening\fR will be emitted when the server
is ready to accept connections.
.
.SS "server.setSecure(credentials)"
Enables HTTPS support for the server, with the crypto module credentials specifying the private key and certificate of the server, and optionally the CA certificates for use in client authentication.
.
.P
If the credentials hold one or more CA certificates, then the server will request for the client to submit a client certificate as part of the HTTPS connection handshake. The validity and content of this can be accessed via verifyPeer() and getPeerCertificate() from the server's request.connection.
.
.SS "server.close()"
Stops the server from accepting new connections.
.
.SH "http.ServerRequest"
This object is created internally by a HTTP server\-\-not by
the user\-\-and passed as the first argument to a \fB'request'\fR listener.
.
.P
This is an EventEmitter with the following events:
.
.SS "Event: 'data'"
\fBfunction (chunk) { }\fR
.
.P
Emitted when a piece of the message body is received.
.
.P
Example: A chunk of the body is given as the single
argument. The transfer\-encoding has been decoded.  The
body chunk is a string.  The body encoding is set with\fBrequest.setBodyEncoding()\fR.
.
.SS "Event: 'end'"
\fBfunction () { }\fR
.
.P
Emitted exactly once for each message. No arguments.  After
emitted no other events will be emitted on the request.
.
.SS "request.method"
The request method as a string. Read only. Example:\fB'GET'\fR, \fB'DELETE'\fR.
.
.SS "request.url"
Request URL string. This contains only the URL that is
present in the actual HTTP request. If the request is:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
GET /status?name=ryan HTTP/1.1\\r\\n
Accept: text/plain\\r\\n
\\r\\n
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Then \fBrequest.url\fR will be:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
'/status?name=ryan'
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
If you would like to parse the URL into its parts, you can use\fBrequire('url').parse(request.url)\fR.  Example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
node> require('url').parse('/status?name=ryan')
{ href: '/status?name=ryan'
, search: '?name=ryan'
, query: 'name=ryan'
, pathname: '/status'
}
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
If you would like to extract the params from the query string,
you can use the \fBrequire('querystring').parse\fR function, or pass \fBtrue\fR as the second argument to \fBrequire('url').parse\fR.  Example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
node> require('url').parse('/status?name=ryan', true)
{ href: '/status?name=ryan'
, search: '?name=ryan'
, query: { name: 'ryan' }

.IP "" 0
.
.SS "request.headers"
Read only.
.
.SS "request.httpVersion"
The HTTP protocol version as a string. Read only. Examples:\fB'1.1'\fR, \fB'1.0'\fR.
Also \fBrequest.httpVersionMajor\fR is the first integer and \fBrequest.httpVersionMinor\fR is the second.
.
.SS "request.setEncoding(encoding='binary')"
Set the encoding for the request body. Either \fB'utf8'\fR or \fB'binary'\fR. Defaults
to \fB'binary'\fR.
.
.SS "request.pause()"
Pauses request from emitting events.  Useful to throttle back an upload.
.
.SS "request.resume()"
Resumes a paused request.
.
.SS "request.connection"
The \fBnet.Stream\fR object assocated with the connection.
.
.P
With HTTPS support, use request.connection.verifyPeer() and
request.connection.getPeerCertificate() to obtain the client's
authentication details.
.
.SH "http.ServerResponse"
This object is created internally by a HTTP server\-\-not by the user. It is
passed as the second parameter to the \fB'request'\fR event. It is a writable stream.
.
.SS "response.writeHead(statusCode[, reasonPhrase] , headers)"
Sends a response header to the request. The status code is a 3\-digit HTTP
status code, like \fB404\fR. The last argument, \fBheaders\fR, are the response headers.
Optionally one can give a human\-readable \fBreasonPhrase\fR as the second
argument.
.
.P
Example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
var body = 'hello world';
response.writeHead(200, {
  'Content\-Length': body.length,
  'Content\-Type': 'text/plain'
});
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
This method must only be called once on a message and it must
be called before \fBresponse.end()\fR is called.
.
.SS "response.write(chunk, encoding)"
This method must be called after \fBwriteHead\fR was
called. It sends a chunk of the response body. This method may
be called multiple times to provide successive parts of the body.
.
.P
If \fBchunk\fR is a string, the second parameter
specifies how to encode it into a byte stream. By default the \fBencoding\fR is \fB'ascii'\fR.
.
.P
\fBNote\fR: This is the raw HTTP body and has nothing to do with
higher\-level multi\-part body encodings that may be used.
.
.P
The first time \fBresponse.write()\fR is called, it will send the buffered
header information and the first body to the client. The second time \fBresponse.write()\fR is called, Node assumes you're going to be streaming
data, and sends that separately. That is, the response is buffered up to the
first chunk of body.
.
.SS "response.end()"
This method signals to the server that all of the response headers and body
has been sent; that server should consider this message complete.
The method, \fBresponse.end()\fR, MUST be called on each
response.
.
.SH "http.Client"
An HTTP client is constructed with a server address as its
argument, the returned handle is then used to issue one or more
requests.  Depending on the server connected to, the client might
pipeline the requests or reestablish the stream after each
stream. \fICurrently the implementation does not pipeline requests.\fR
.
.P
Example of connecting to \fBgoogle.com\fR:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
var sys = require('sys'),
   http = require('http');
var google = http.createClient(80, 'www.google.com');
var request = google.request('GET', '/',
  {'host': 'www.google.com'});
request.addListener('response', function (response) {
  sys.puts('STATUS: ' + response.statusCode);
  sys.puts('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(response.headers));
  response.setEncoding('utf8');
  response.addListener('data', function (chunk) {
    sys.puts('BODY: ' + chunk);
  });
});
request.end();
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "http.createClient(port, host, secure, credentials)"
Constructs a new HTTP client. \fBport\fR and \fBhost\fR refer to the server to be connected to. A
stream is not established until a request is issued.
.
.P
\fBsecure\fR is an optional boolean flag to enable https support and \fBcredentials\fR is an optional credentials object from the crypto module, which may hold the client's private key, certificate, and a list of trusted CA certificates.
.
.P
If the connection is secure, but no explicit CA certificates are passed in the credentials, then node.js will default to the publicly trusted list of CA certificates, as given in http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt
.
.SS "client.request([method], path, [request_headers])"
Issues a request; if necessary establishes stream. Returns a \fBhttp.ClientRequest\fR instance.
.
.P
\fBmethod\fR is optional and defaults to 'GET' if omitted.
.
.P
\fBrequest_headers\fR is optional.
Additional request headers might be added internally
by Node. Returns a \fBClientRequest\fR object.
.
.P
Do remember to include the \fBContent\-Length\fR header if you
plan on sending a body. If you plan on streaming the body, perhaps
set \fBTransfer\-Encoding: chunked\fR.
.
.P
\fINOTE\fR: the request is not complete. This method only sends the header of
the request. One needs to call \fBrequest.end()\fR to finalize the request and
retrieve the response.  (This sounds convoluted but it provides a chance for
the user to stream a body to the server with \fBrequest.write()\fR.)
.
.SS "client.verifyPeer()"
Returns true or false depending on the validity of the server's certificate in the context of the defined or default list of trusted CA certificates.
.
.SS "client.getPeerCertificate()"
Returns a JSON structure detailing the server's certificate, containing a dictionary with keys for the certificate 'subject', 'issuer', 'valid_from' and 'valid_to'
.
.SH "http.ClientRequest"
This object is created internally and returned from the \fBrequest()\fR method
of a \fBhttp.Client\fR. It represents an \fIin\-progress\fR request whose header has
already been sent.
.
.P
To get the response, add a listener for \fB'response'\fR to the request object. \fB'response'\fR will be emitted from the request object when the response
headers have been received.  The \fB'response'\fR event is executed with one
argument which is an instance of \fBhttp.ClientResponse\fR.
.
.P
During the \fB'response'\fR event, one can add listeners to the
response object; particularly to listen for the \fB'data'\fR event. Note that
the \fB'response'\fR event is called before any part of the response body is received,
so there is no need to worry about racing to catch the first part of the
body. As long as a listener for \fB'data'\fR is added during the \fB'response'\fR
event, the entire body will be caught.
.

.P
Emitted when a response is received to this request. This event is emitted only once. The\fBresponse\fR argument will be an instance of \fBhttp.ClientResponse\fR.
.
.SS "request.write(chunk, encoding='ascii')"
Sends a chunk of the body.  By calling this method
many times, the user can stream a request body to a
server\-\-in that case it is suggested to use the\fB['Transfer\-Encoding', 'chunked']\fR header line when
creating the request.
.
.P
The \fBchunk\fR argument should be an array of integers
or a string.
.
.P
The \fBencoding\fR argument is optional and only
applies when \fBchunk\fR is a string. The encoding
argument should be either \fB'utf8'\fR or \fB'ascii'\fR. By default the body uses ASCII encoding,
as it is faster.
.
.SS "request.end()"
Finishes sending the request. If any parts of the body are
unsent, it will flush them to the stream. If the request is
chunked, this will send the terminating \fB'0\\r\\n\\r\\n'\fR.
.
.SH "http.ClientResponse"
This object is created when making a request with \fBhttp.Client\fR. It is
passed to the \fB'response'\fR event of the request object.

.SS "net.createServer(connectionListener)"
Creates a new TCP server. The \fBconnection_listener\fR argument is
automatically set as a listener for the \fB'connection'\fR event.
.
.SS "server.listen(port, host=null)"
Tells the server to listen for TCP connections to \fBport\fR and \fBhost\fR.
.
.P
\fBhost\fR is optional. If \fBhost\fR is not specified the server will accept client
connections on any network address.
.
.P
This function is asynchronous. The server will emit \fB'listening'\fR when it is
safe to connect to it.
.
.SS "server.close()"
Stops the server from accepting new connections. This function is
asynchronous, the server is finally closed when the server emits a \fB'close'\fR
event.
.
.SH "net.Stream"
This object is an abstraction of of a TCP or UNIX socket.  \fBnet.Stream\fR
instance implement a duplex stream interface.  They can be created by the
user and used as a client (with \fBconnect()\fR) or they can be created by Node
and passed to the user through the \fB'connection'\fR event of a server.
.
.P
\fBnet.Stream\fR instances are an EventEmitters with the following events:
.
.SS "Event: 'connect'"
\fBfunction () { }\fR
.
.P
Emitted when a stream connection successfully is established.
See \fBconnect()\fR.
.
.SS "Event: 'secure'"
\fBfunction () { }\fR

.P
Emitted when a stream connection successfully establishes a HTTPS handshake with its peer.
.
.SS "Event: 'data'"
\fBfunction (data) { }\fR
.
.P
Emitted when data is received.  The argument \fBdata\fR will be a \fBBuffer\fR or \fBString\fR.  Encoding of data is set by \fBstream.setEncoding()\fR.
(See the section on Readable Streams for more infromation.)
.
.SS "Event: 'end'"
\fBfunction () { }\fR
.
.P
Emitted when the other end of the stream sends a FIN packet. After this is
emitted the \fBreadyState\fR will be \fB'writeOnly'\fR. One should probably just
call \fBstream.end()\fR when this event is emitted.
.
.SS "Event: 'timeout'"
\fBfunction () { }\fR
.
.P
Emitted if the stream times out from inactivity. This is only to notify that
the stream has been idle. The user must manually close the connection.
.
.P
See also: \fBstream.setTimeout()\fR
.
.SS "Event: 'drain'"
\fBfunction () { }\fR
.
.P
Emitted when the write buffer becomes empty. Can be used to throttle uploads.
.
.SS "Event: 'error'"
\fBfunction (exception) { }\fR
.
.P
Emitted when an error occurs.  The \fB'close'\fR event will be called directly
following this event.
.
.SS "Event: 'close'"
\fBfunction () { }\fR
.
.P
Emitted once the stream is fully closed. The argument \fBhad_error\fR is a boolean which says if
the stream was closed due to a transmission
error.
.
.SS "net.createConnection(port, host='127.0.0.1')"
Construct a new stream object and opens a stream to the specified \fBport\fR
and \fBhost\fR. If the second parameter is omitted, localhost is assumed.
.
.P
When the stream is established the \fB'connect'\fR event will be emitted.
.
.SS "stream.connect(port, host='127.0.0.1')"
Opens a stream to the specified \fBport\fR and \fBhost\fR. \fBcreateConnection()\fR
also opens a stream; normally this method is not needed. Use this only if
a stream is closed and you want to reuse the object to connect to another
server.
.
.P
This function is asynchronous. When the \fB'connect'\fR event is emitted the
stream is established. If there is a problem connecting, the \fB'connect'\fR
event will not be emitted, the \fB'error'\fR event will be emitted with
the exception.
.
.SS "stream.remoteAddress"
The string representation of the remote IP address. For example,\fB'74.125.127.100'\fR or \fB'2001:4860:a005::68'\fR.

.SS "stream.setSecure(credentials)"
Enables HTTPS support for the stream, with the crypto module credentials specifying the private key and certificate of the stream, and optionally the CA certificates for use in peer authentication.
.
.P
If the credentials hold one ore more CA certificates, then the stream will request for the peer to submit a client certificate as part of the HTTPS connection handshake. The validity and content of this can be accessed via verifyPeer() and getPeerCertificate().
.
.SS "stream.verifyPeer()"
Returns true or false depending on the validity of the peers's certificate in the context of the defined or default list of trusted CA certificates.
.
.SS "stream.getPeerCertificate()"
Returns a JSON structure detailing the peer's certificate, containing a dictionary with keys for the certificate 'subject', 'issuer', 'valid_from' and 'valid_to'
.
.SS "stream.write(data, encoding='ascii')"
Sends data on the stream. The second parameter specifies the encoding in
the case of a string\-\-it defaults to ASCII because encoding to UTF8 is rather
slow.
.
.P
Returns \fBtrue\fR if the entire data was flushed successfully to the kernel
buffer. Returns \fBfalse\fR if all or part of the data was queued in user memory. \fB'drain'\fR will be emitted when the buffer is again free.
.
.SS "stream.end()"
Half\-closes the stream. I.E., it sends a FIN packet. It is possible the
server will still send some data. After calling this \fBreadyState\fR will be \fB'readOnly'\fR.
.
.SS "stream.destroy()"
Ensures that no more I/O activity happens on this stream. Only necessary in
case of errors (parse error or so).

local to the module will be private. In this example the variable \fBPI\fR is
private to \fBcircle.js\fR. The function \fBputs()\fR comes from the module \fB'sys'\fR,
which is a built\-in module. Modules which are not prefixed by \fB'./'\fR are
built\-in module\-\-more about this later.
.
.P
A module prefixed with \fB'./'\fR is relative to the file calling \fBrequire()\fR.
That is, \fBcircle.js\fR must be in the same directory as \fBfoo.js\fR for \fBrequire('./circle')\fR to find it.
.
.P
Without the leading \fB'./'\fR, like \fBrequire('assert')\fR the module is searched
for in the \fBrequire.paths\fR array. \fBrequire.paths\fR on my system looks like
this:
.
.P
\fB[ '/home/ryan/.node_libraries' ]\fR
.
.P
That is, when \fBrequire('assert')\fR is called Node looks for:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
1: \fB/home/ryan/.node_libraries/assert.js\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
2: \fB/home/ryan/.node_libraries/assert.node\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
3: \fB/home/ryan/.node_libraries/assert/index.js\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
4: \fB/home/ryan/.node_libraries/assert/index.node\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
interrupting once a file is found. Files ending in \fB'.node'\fR are binary Addon
Modules; see 'Addons' below. \fB'index.js'\fR allows one to package a module as
a directory.
.
.P
\fBrequire.paths\fR can be modified at runtime by simply unshifting new
paths onto it, or at startup with the \fBNODE_PATH\fR environmental
variable (which should be a list of paths, colon separated).
.
.SH "Addons"
Addons are dynamically linked shared objects. They can provide glue to C and
C++ libraries. The API (at the moment) is rather complex, involving
knowledge of several libraries:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
V8 JavaScript, a C++ library. Used for interfacing with JavaScript:
creating objects, calling functions, etc.  Documented mostly in the\fBv8.h\fR header file (\fBdeps/v8/include/v8.h\fR in the Node source tree).
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
libev, C event loop library. Anytime one needs to wait for a file
descriptor to become readable, wait for a timer, or wait for a signal to
received one will need to interface with libev.  That is, if you perform
any I/O, libev will need to be used.  Node uses the \fBEV_DEFAULT\fR event
loop.  Documentation can be found http:/cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.html[here].
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
libeio, C thread pool library. Used to execute blocking POSIX system
calls asynchronously. Mostly wrappers already exist for such calls, in\fBsrc/file.cc\fR so you will probably not need to use it. If you do need it,
look at the header file \fBdeps/libeio/eio.h\fR.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Internal Node libraries. Most importantly is the \fBnode::ObjectWrap\fR
class which you will likely want to derive from.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Others. Look in \fBdeps/\fR for what else is available.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Node statically compiles all its dependencies into the executable. When
compiling your module, you don't need to worry about linking to any of these
libraries.
.
.P
To get started let's make a small Addon which does the following except in
C++:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
exports.hello = 'world';
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
To get started we create a file \fBhello.cc\fR:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
#include <v8.h>
using namespace v8;
extern 'C' void
init (Handle<Object> target)
{
  HandleScope scope;
  target\->Set(String::New("hello"), String::New("World"));
}
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
This source code needs to be built into \fBhello.node\fR, the binary Addon. To
do this we create a file called \fBwscript\fR which is python code and looks
like this:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
srcdir = '.'
blddir = 'build'
VERSION = '0.0.1'
def set_options(opt):
  opt.tool_options('compiler_cxx')
def configure(conf):
  conf.check_tool('compiler_cxx')
  conf.check_tool('node_addon')
def build(bld):
  obj = bld.new_task_gen('cxx', 'shlib', 'node_addon')
  obj.target = 'hello'
  obj.source = 'hello.cc'
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Running \fBnode\-waf configure build\fR will create a file \fBbuild/default/hello.node\fR which is our Addon.
.
.P
\fBnode\-waf\fR is just http://code.google.com/p/waf/[WAF], the python\-based build system. \fBnode\-waf\fR is
provided for the ease of users.
.
.P
All Node addons must export a function called \fBinit\fR with this signature:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
extern 'C' void init (Handle<Object> target)
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
For the moment, that is all the documentation on addons. Please see\fIhttp://github.com/ry/node_postgres\fR for a real example.
